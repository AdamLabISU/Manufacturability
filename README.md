# Deep Learning based Design for Manufacturing
This is a repository to train a 3D convolutional neural network for manufacturability analysis of drilled holes. The data can be downloaded from [http://web.me.iastate.edu/adamlab/r-manufacturability.html](http://web.me.iastate.edu/adamlab/r-manufacturability.html). For more details, please refer to our paper presented in Geometric Modeling and Processing 2018, Germany.

## Dependencies
1. Keras
2. Tensorflow
3. Joblib

This code is written for Python/3, we do not support Python/2 currently. We will add it soon.

## Usage

To be populated soon...

## License

BSD, Can use it for any non-profit work, as long as you cite the paper.

## Future work
GPU accelerated Voxelization code written in pure python.
